# Research Summary: Automated Coder Deliverable Generation

**Date:** 2025-06-25

## 1. Objective

This research was conducted to identify the best methods within the `GitPython` library to generate a list of changed files and a full diff between two commits, as required for the automated coder deliverable.

## 2. Findings

### Getting the Full Diff

- **Conclusion:** The existing `get_diff(from_commit, to_commit)` function in `git_handler.py` is already suitable for this task. It uses `repo.git.diff(from_commit, to_commit)`, which directly returns the raw diff output as a string.

### Getting a List of Changed Files

- **Conclusion:** The most robust and Pythonic way to get a list of changed files is to use the `diff()` method on a `Commit` object, which returns a `DiffIndex` object.
- **Implementation:**
    1.  Get the commit object for the starting SHA: `from_commit = repo.commit(sha)`.
    2.  Get the diff against the current `HEAD`: `diff_index = from_commit.diff(repo.head.commit)`.
    3.  Iterate through the `diff_index` to get the path of each changed file. For each `diff` object in the index, `diff.b_path` will provide the file path.

## 3. Recommended Implementation Strategy

The implementation plan from the technical specification is confirmed. The research indicates that `git_handler.py` should be updated with a new function, `get_changes_since_commit(commit_sha)`, that returns both the list of changed files and the full diff string. This function will encapsulate the `GitPython` logic identified in this research, providing a clean interface for the `state_manager` to use when generating the deliverable.
